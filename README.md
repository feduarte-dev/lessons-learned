This is my first JavaScript project at Trybe. I have written seven functions using various JavaScript methods and have become more comfortable with coding.

## Project Description

This JavaScript project aims to test my ability to solve problems with code. Here are the key aspects of the project:

### Project Structure

The project consists of a single js file (`functions.js`) and an some tests using Jest (`/tests`).

### Technologies

- LINUX
- VSCODE
- JAVASCRIPT

### What I Learned

- How to iterate an array using loops
- How to use conditionals
- How to work js methods
- How to write semantic functions
- How to debug a function using VSCode

## How to Run the Project

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/feduarte-dev/exercise-functions
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
